        "\n",
        "Real-world healthcare data is often messy. It can have missing values or **outliers** (extreme values that might be errors).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Missing Data Strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Finding:** Use `.isna().sum()` to count missing values per column.\n",
        "  * **Dropping:** Use `.dropna()` to remove rows with missing data. This is okay for a small number of missing rows, but can introduce bias if the missingness is not random.\n",
        "  * **Imputing:** Use `.fillna()` to replace missing values. A powerful technique is to impute by a sub-group. For example, filling a missing temperature with the *median temperature of the patient's specific ward*.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Outlier Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Visualization:** A **boxplot** is the best way to visualize outliers.\n",
        "  * **Calculation:** The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method is standard. Outliers are typically defined as values below `Q1 - 1.5*IQR` or above `Q3 + 1.5*IQR`.\n",
